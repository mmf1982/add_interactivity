# add_interactivity

Adding a moveable and clickable legend:

click anywhere in the legend to move

left click on a legend line toggles that line

right click on a legend line bring it to the front

middle click on a legend line opens a dialog to type a new name for that line, press enter when done.

If no arguments are provided, it acts on the current active axis and creates a legend with automated names, i.e. if nothing was set as label, line0 etc...
